[b][i]Mod version: 1.2.4[/i][/b]

[h1]General Features[/h1]

[olist]
 [*] With this mod natural disasters occur in more natural way, depending on weather, season, or time passed since the last disaster. 
 [*] You can Force disasters from any level (from 0.0 to 25.5).

 [*] Maximum intensity of all disasters is set to 1.0 at the beginning of the game and gradually increases up to the maximum (25.5) until the city population reaches the max value (By default 100k, but can set it from 20k to 800k).
 [*] Duration of small intensity thunderstorms is decreased.

 [*] You can disable specific disasters from Setup menu or information panel.

[h1] About my favorite enhancement and why I did this: Automatic focused evacuations/releases: [/h1]
[list]
 [*] You can choose if want manual evacuation, Ragnarok’s automatic evacuation/release or an automatic focused evacuation based on disaster selected.
 [*] It means that only affected zone in a defined radio would be evacuated/released. 
 [*] In case of disasters like Meteor strikes, earthquakes (with cracks) and sinkholes, the shelters inside the destruction radio won’t be evacuated (We don’t want to kill anyone).
 [*] In case that evacuation radius is minor to destruction radius, second one will be the base to evacuate (based on Disaster radius).
 [*] Not all tornadoes will destroy the roads, only 10+ intensity. (Reading a bit, not all tornadoes destroy the roads, only stronger)
 [*] You can select the base intensity to crack the ground during an earthquake, just no cracks or cracks during any earthquake.
 [*] Disaster Pile: When you have multiple disasters in progress affecting the same shelters, these won’t be evacuated until last disaster closer is done (in automatic modes).

[h1]About time lapse[/h1]

The time lapse used by this mod is set by the game and impacts how often the disasters happen, if you use vanilla time you will notice disasters happen more often, if you use the "Real Time" mod it will slow down the frequency of these.

[h1]What if I use Skyve?[/h1]
Make sure you enable the mod into your Skyve's profile mod list, otherwise you cannot see it into content manager neither the game.
